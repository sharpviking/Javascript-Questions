Why should currying be used?
Following are the reasons why currying is good :

✅ It makes a function pure which makes it expose to less errors and side effects.

✅ It helps in avoiding the same variable again and again.

✅ It is a checking method that checks if you have all the things before you proceed.

✅ It divides one function into multiple functions so that one handles one set of responsibility.
